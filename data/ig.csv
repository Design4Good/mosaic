"LGBTQ San Diego County News is Updating!

After a necessary pause for my healing, I am making important adjustments and updates to the company and website. These changes are vital for the survival of our community’s only LGBTQ newspaper.

I appreciate your patience and support. Stay tuned for more updates, including a relaunch of the website, and the return of our print edition in the near future. Give and help us survive hate by visiting: LGBTQSD.news/Support.

Still here, still fighting. Onward!

"Memories and reflections of Pride
Because it is the 50th anniversary of San Diego Pride, Morgan & Benny ventured out and asked people to ponder the question, “What is your fondest memory of San Diego Pride?” We asked a few others, “What does Pride mean to you?”

"Thank You Manchester! When I first decided to plan this protest I thought maybe 30 people would show support. To have over a thousand people show up for trans rights was mind-blowing.

I just want to thank every single one of you. To everyone who donated funds, PPE, time or advice. To all our powerful, iconic speakers, whether it was your first or hundredth time speaking, you were all magical. It was an honour to hear your rage, your fear, your happiness and hope.

The sky opened up in response to our power and we marched through it. We are fighting, we will not be quiet, we will not let the government crush us and take away our rights. We are strong and we stand with all marginalised people. Together we can beat bigotry.

My name is Viktor, and I'm honoured to be part of this community. Thank you all 💛",https://www.instagram.com/p/CCBheCrgbDW/
"Jim Desmond is trying to drag San Diego County into the nationwide attack on trans people. He’s pushing for the Board of Supervisors to support H.R.28, a federal bill that would ban trans women and girls from sports.

We can’t let this happen. The Board is meeting soon, and we need to show up, speak out, and shut this down. Opposing this agenda means standing up for trans athletes and making it clear that they belong in sports. Supporting it means siding with discrimination and erasing trans people from public life. There’s no middle ground.

Public comments are open—go leave a statement telling them that San Diego won’t stand for this kind of bigotry. Demand that our leaders reject this attack and stand for inclusion.
