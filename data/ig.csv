"Thank You Manchester! When I first decided to plan this protest I thought maybe 30 people would show support. To have over a thousand people show up for trans rights was mind-blowing.

I just want to thank every single one of you. To everyone who donated funds, PPE, time or advice. To all our powerful, iconic speakers, whether it was your first or hundredth time speaking, you were all magical. It was an honour to hear your rage, your fear, your happiness and hope.

The sky opened up in response to our power and we marched through it. We are fighting, we will not be quiet, we will not let the government crush us and take away our rights. We are strong and we stand with all marginalised people. Together we can beat bigotry.

My name is Viktor, and I'm honoured to be part of this community. Thank you all 💛",https://www.instagram.com/p/CCBheCrgbDW/
"Jim Desmond is trying to drag San Diego County into the nationwide attack on trans people. He’s pushing for the Board of Supervisors to support H.R.28, a federal bill that would ban trans women and girls from sports.

We can’t let this happen. The Board is meeting soon, and we need to show up, speak out, and shut this down. Opposing this agenda means standing up for trans athletes and making it clear that they belong in sports. Supporting it means siding with discrimination and erasing trans people from public life. There’s no middle ground.

Public comments are open—go leave a statement telling them that San Diego won’t stand for this kind of bigotry. Demand that our leaders reject this attack and stand for inclusion.
